# Turtle Soup Generator
A Situation Puzzle Generator | Final Project for CIS 700 Interactive Fiction Generation

Project Description
-------------------

A situation puzzle generator where the user is given the start and end of a story and is asked to guess the whole story. The user can query if a situation has happened and our model will return True or False as a hint. 

Methods:
--------

- Two models & Connecting Components
    - Generative model 
      - Input: start and end of the stories 
      - loss function: NLL
      - Evaluation: Story cloze test (?)
      - Implementation: TBD
    - QA model 
      - A simple classification model, just checking if the userâ€™s guess exists in the steps (compare with: item lookup homework). 
      - Return only Yes/No to users, 
      - Implementation: TBD (likely GPT family models)
      - (optional) return additional hint in the future plan.
    - Connecting Generative model and QA model 

Data:
-----

- [Kith Situation Puzzle](https://kith.org/logos/things/sitpuz/situations.html)
    - The amount of data available is ~100 instances of situation puzzles. We have also found chinese versions available (which could be backup data if we need)
