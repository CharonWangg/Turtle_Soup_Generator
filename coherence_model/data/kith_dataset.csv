0,0,"1.1.  A man goes into a restaurant, orders abalone, eats
one bite, and kills himself.  (TeM and JM wording)","1.1 answer:  The man was in a ship that was wrecked on a desert island. 
When there was no food left, another passenger brought what he said was
abalone but was really part of the man's wife (who had died in the wreck). 
The man suspects something fishy, so when they finally return to
civilization, he orders abalone, realizes that what he ate before was his
wife, and kills himself.  (In a slight variant, from Stories With
Holes, he simply faints rather than killing himself.)"
1,1,"1.1a.  Variant: same problem statement but with albatross instead of
abalone.","1.1a answer:  In this version, the man was in a lifeboat, with his wife,
who died.  He hallucinated an albatross landing in the boat which he caught
and killed and ate; he thought that his wife had been washed overboard. 
When he actually eats albatross, he discovers that he had actually eaten his
wife."
2,2,1.1b.  Variant: A man kills himself rather than order albatross.,"1.1b answer:  The man already knew that he had eaten human flesh under
the name ""albatross.""  He asks the waiter in the restaurant what kind of
soup is available, and the waiter responds, ""Albatross soup.""  Thinking that
""albatross soup"" means ""human soup,"" and sickened by the thought of such a
society (place in a foreign country if necessary), he kills himself.  (from
Mike Neergaard)  I'm afraid this version doesn't make a whole lot of
sense."
3,3,"1.2.  A man lives on the twelfth floor of an apartment
building.  Every morning he takes the elevator down to the lobby and leaves
the building.  In the evening, he gets into the elevator, and, if there is
someone else in the elevator -- or if it was raining that day -- he goes
back to his floor directly.  However, if there is nobody else in the
elevator and it hasn't rained, he goes to the tenth floor and walks up two
flights of stairs to his room.  (MH, from How Come?)","1.2 answer:  The man is a midget.  He can't reach the upper elevator
buttons, but he can ask people to push them for him.  He can also push them
with his umbrella.  I've usually heard this stated with more details: ""Every
morning he wakes up, gets dressed, eats, goes to the elevator...""  In the
other direction, for a shorter problem statement, leave out the ""someone
else in the elevator"" and ""if it was raining"" parts, and just say on his
return to the building he always goes to the tenth floor.  Ron Carter
suggests a nice red herring: the man lives on the 13th floor of the
building."
4,4,"1.2a.  Variant: Emily regularly visits the twelfth floor of an apartment
building by going to the tenth floor and walking up two flights of stairs. 
Last year she only took the elevator to the ninth floor.  (Math for
Girls)","1.2a answer:  Emily is a child; she can only reach the tenth-floor
button, and last year she could only reach the ninth-floor button."
5,5,"1.3.  A man sitting on a park bench reads a newspaper
article headlined ""Death at Sea"" and knows a murder has been committed. 
(from How Come?)","1.3 answer:  The man is a travel agent.  He had sold someone two tickets
for an ocean voyage, one round-trip and one one-way.  The last name of the
man who bought the tickets is the same as the last name of the woman who
""fell"" overboard and drowned on the same voyage, which is the subject of the
article he's reading.  This may have derived from a story done by Alfred
Hitchcock, if the following Hitchcock quotation is accurate: ""If you take
your wife on a sea voyage, buy her a round-trip ticket no matter what your
plans may be.""  According to How Come?, it's loosely based on
the real-life case of a killer named Henry Landru."
6,6,"1.4.  A man lets go of a bowling ball.  A short while
later, he is rushed to the hospital.  (JC original?)","1.4 answer:  A physics professor is demonstrating conservation of energy
by suspending a bowling ball from a piece of rope.  He pulls the ball back
until it's right in front of his nose, then lets go.  It is supposed to
swing away from him, then back at him, stopping just in front of his nose. 
Unfortunately, he gave the ball a slight push, resulting in the ball
crashing into his nose upon its return."
7,7,"2.1.  A man is born in 1972 and dies in 1952 at the age
of 25.  (DM)","2.1 answer:  He's born in room number 1972 of a hospital and dies in room
number 1952.  The numbers can of course vary; it was originally set up with
those numbers reversed (born in 1952, died in 1972), but I like it better
this way."
8,8,"2.2.  A man is found dead in the arctic with a pack on
his back.  (This is different from #1.25, #1.24, and #2.12.)  (PRO)","2.2 answer:  It's a wolf pack; they've killed and eaten (most of) the
man."
9,9,"2.3.  A man pushes a car up to a hotel and tells the
owner he's bankrupt. (DVS; partial AL and JM wording)",2.3 answer:  It's a game of Monopoly.
10,10,"2.3a.  Variant: The car came out of the blue and the man came into some
money.","2.3a answer:  The same; in this case the car token passes Go and the
player collects $200.  (from ""Mo,"" whose full name I missed)"
11,11,"2.4.  A man lies dead in a room with fifty-three
bicycles in front of him.","2.4 answer:  The ""bicycles"" are Bicycle playing cards; the man was
cheating at cards, and when the extra card was found, he was killed by the
other players."
12,12,2.4a.  Variant: There are 53 bees instead of 53 bicycles.,2.4a answer:  The same (Bee is another brand of playing cards).
13,13,2.4b.  Variant: There are 51 instead of 53.,"2.4b answer:  Someone saw the guy conceal a card, and proved the deck was
defective by turning it up and pointing out the missing ace.  Or, the game
was bridge, and the others noticed the cheating when the deal didn't come
out even.  The man had palmed an ace during the shuffle and meant to put it
in his own hand during the deal, but muffed it.  (both answers from Mark
Brader)"
